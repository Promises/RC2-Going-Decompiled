# Licensing

## This project

SPDX-License-Identifier: `GPL-2.0-or-later`

The project's own work is licensed under the GNU General Public License,
version 2 or (at your option) any later version. That covers the decompiled C
and C++, headers, splat configuration, symbol names, build and verification
tools, and documentation. The full text is in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

The licence covers only that work. It grants no rights in **Ratchet & Clank:
Going Commando** itself. The game's code, data, assets, names and trademarks
belong to their owners. This repository contains none of them, and nothing
derived from your copy of the game (the disassembly, extracted assets, the
built image) is tracked.

## Bundled third-party source

These directories hold upstream source, unmodified unless stated. Each keeps
its own licence, and its notices are preserved in the files.

| Path | Origin | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `going-decompiled/libgcc/` | GCC's `libgcc2.c`, `fp-bit.c` and `longlong.h` from the GCC repository; `cygnus-ee/` from the Cygnus EE toolchain tree (see `PROVENANCE` there) | GPL-2.0-or-later with the GCC runtime exception (stated in each file); text in `going-decompiled/libgcc/COPYING` |
| `going-decompiled/libc/newlib/` | newlib's R5900 string and memory routines (`*.S`), Copyright (C) 1999 Cygnus Solutions | The Cygnus permission notice in each file: use, copy, modify and distribute freely, provided the notice is kept |
| `going-decompiled/libm/newlib/` | newlib's libm `fdlibm.h`, `s_isnan.c` and `w_sqrt.c`, Copyright (C) 1993 Sun Microsystems, Inc. | The SunPro permission notice in each file: use, copy, modify and distribute freely, provided the notice is kept |

The `shim/` directories under `libgcc/` and `libm/` are written by this project
and fall under its own licence.

## Not included

The SN Systems ProDG compiler and the Sony PS2 SDK headers and libraries are
proprietary and are not part of this repository. The `scripts/fetch_*.sh`
scripts download them for a local build.
