# asm_unit.sh — assemble a whole compiled unit (cc1 output .s that pulls in
# per-function asm via INCLUDE_ASM's `.include "going-decompiled/asm/.../F.s"`)
# into a single object, applying the VU0 fixup to the included asm.
#
# Runs INSIDE the ee-build container (colima x86 VM):
#   docker --context colima-ee-x86 run --rm -v "$PWD":/work ee-build \
#       sh tools/ee/asm_unit.sh <region> <unit.s> <out.o>
#   e.g. ... sh tools/ee/asm_unit.sh usa /work/build/cod_015180.s out.o
#
# WHY the mirror+cd dance:
#   INCLUDE_ASM hardcodes a *source-relative* include path
#   (`going-decompiled/asm/<region>/nonmatchings/<unit>/<func>.s`). GNU as
#   resolves a relative `.include` against the CWD before any -I dir, so we
#   cannot redirect it with -I alone. Instead we build a filtered MIRROR of the
#   asm tree (each .s passed through tools/ee/vu0_fixup.sed, which only rewrites
#   VU0 Q/ACC operands and is a no-op everywhere else) plus macro.inc, then run
#   `as` with its CWD at the mirror root so every `.include` resolves to the
#   fixed-up copy. Encoding is byte-identical to the original (the fixup only
#   adds the `$` prefix GNU as requires on the Q/ACC special registers).
