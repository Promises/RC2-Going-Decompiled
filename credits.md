- **Made in Slovakia — Ratchet & Clank PCSX2 cheat codes**
  <https://github.com/Made-in-Slovakia/rac>

  Their cheat codes for *Going Commando* USA v2.00 (CRC `B3A71D10`) gave this
  project its first naming anchors. Each cheat writes to an exact address with a
  known meaning (bolts, health, ammo, unlock flags), which named many globals
  before any code around them had been read. `tools/ee/pnach_to_symbols.py`
  turned them into naming hypotheses, and each one was confirmed against the
  code that writes it before entering `going-decompiled/symbol_addrs/`.

  The cheat files themselves are not redistributed here. See the link above.
